# Amazon Sales Analysis – Key Insights

## Coupon vs Sponsored Performance

Sponsored products without coupons show the highest average monthly sales volume.

Coupons appear to increase sales for organic listings, but their effect is much smaller
than Amazon Sponsored placement.

This suggests that paid visibility (Sponsored status) is a stronger sales driver than
price discounts alone, and coupons may be most effective as a secondary tactic.
